The Vacu-Arm is a robotic arm system engineered to automate pick-and-place operations using a vacuum-based suction mechanism. Built around the Universal Robots UR20 robotic arm and controlled via a ROS-based software architecture, the Vacu-Arm is capable of safely handling objects up to 50 pounds with precision and repeatability. This system is designed to enhance efficiency in light industrial settings by reducing manual labor and human error in repetitive handling tasks such as sorting, packaging, or part transfer.

This document is built upon the System Requirements Specification (SRS) and Architectural Design Specification (ADS) to define the functional and structural design decisions. For a comprehensive understanding of the system's high-level requirements and architectural framework refer to the SRS and the ADS, which serve as the foundation for the detailed design decisions presented in this specification.
