The main solution to these repetitive tasks is to program the arm to pick up boxes and place them in a palletized location. Boxes are layed out on a conveyor belt, which are stopped at the end with a photoeye sensor that is connected to the UR20 control box. The arm will start above the box location, slowly go down until enough force is applied on the box, then apply suction to pick it up. The UR20 arm then goes to the palletizing area to place the box down and repeats this process until all boxes are unloaded.
