The main stakeholders are the professors at UT Arlington that are interested in finding a use for the UR20 arm, such as Steven Mcdermott. The undergraduates are one computer engineering major, Andrew Weiler, three computer science majors, Andrew Whitmill, Seezayn Bishwokarma, and Samriddha Kharel, as well as one software engineer, Jonathon Camarce. Future stakeholders are the members that continue the work off the UR20 arm.
